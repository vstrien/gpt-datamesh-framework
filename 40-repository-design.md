Opting for a single repository for all code, including IaC and CI/CD pipeline definitions (YAML), can be a good choice for many organizations. Here are some reasons to include IaC and CI/CD pipeline definitions in the same repository:

1. Easier dependency and version management: Having all components in the same repository allows you to manage dependencies and versions across IaC, implementation code, and pipeline definitions more easily.

2. Consistency: Keeping all components together ensures consistency across your infrastructure, code, and pipelines. It's easier to keep everything in sync when making updates or modifications.

3. Simplified CI/CD pipeline: A single repository allows for a more straightforward CI/CD pipeline, as you can build, test, and deploy all components together, reducing the complexity of coordinating between multiple repositories.

4. Better visibility and collaboration: A single repository provides better visibility into the entire project, making it easier for team members to collaborate and contribute to different parts of the project.

5. Atomic changes: With a single repository, you can make atomic commits that include changes to infrastructure, code, and pipelines, ensuring that all related updates are deployed together.

However, it's important to also consider potential drawbacks:

1. Larger repository size: A single repository containing all components can grow in size, making cloning, pulling, and pushing slower.

2. More merge conflicts: With multiple teams working on different components in the same repository, there may be a higher chance of merge conflicts.

To mitigate some of the drawbacks, you can use strategies such as organizing your repository with a clear directory structure, using Git LFS (Large File Storage) for large files, and establishing clear branching and merging strategies.

In summary, including IaC-code and CI/CD pipeline definitions (YAML) in the same repository as your implementation code can provide benefits in terms of consistency, dependency management, and CI/CD pipeline simplification. This approach may work well for your organization if you prioritize these factors and can manage the potential drawbacks.

Great. I'll opt for one single repository.
