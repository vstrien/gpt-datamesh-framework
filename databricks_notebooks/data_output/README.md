This Data Output Notebook writes valid and invalid records, which were separated based on data quality rules, to different storage paths as Parquet files. The file names include a timestamp to ensure uniqueness and to allow for versioning or historical data preservation. You can modify the storage options, file formats, or partitioning details as needed for your specific use case.

Once the data is written to the appropriate sinks, you can use it for further processing, analysis, or visualization, depending on your requirements.
