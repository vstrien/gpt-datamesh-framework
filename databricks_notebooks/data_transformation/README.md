This Data Transformation Notebook example reads the metadata for transformations and their dependencies, and applies the specified transformations (e.g., filter, select, join, aggregate) to the input DataFrames. The `apply_transformations_recursively` function handles dependencies between transformations, ensuring that they are executed in the correct order. The resulting transformed DataFrames are stored in the `executed_transformations` dictionary.

You can extend this example to support additional transformation types and customizations as needed. By implementing the transformations based on metadata, you can create a flexible and extensible Data Transformation Notebook that adapts to various data processing scenarios without having to modify the code.

Once you have the transformed DataFrames, you can pass them on to the subsequent stages of your data processing framework, such as data quality checks, data output, and data visualization. This Data Transformation Notebook can be integrated with other components of your data processing framework in Azure Databricks to form a complete, metadata-driven data processing solution.

In this updated Data Transformation Notebook, we've added logging for each transformation applied and stored the processed data in the specified storage path as Parquet files. The file names include a timestamp to ensure uniqueness and to allow for versioning or historical data preservation.

With these updates, you'll have a better record of the operations performed, making it easier to audit, debug, and monitor your data processing pipeline. Feel free to modify the storage options, file formats, or logging details as needed for your specific use case.
