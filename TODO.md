# To do

Based on the discussions with ChatGPT and the observed results, there are several things to be done:

- [ ] Create a module for the `utils`-package, and maintain it in a separate repository. This makes it easier to update the `utils` package without having to update the notebooks themselves inside the Databricks repository
- [ ] Create a reference implementation and see how far it gets, and what major roadblocks arise.
