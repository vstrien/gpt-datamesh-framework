These tables will help you manage configuration data related to your data processing pipeline. The `ConfigurationCategory` table stores categories for organizing configuration items, while the `ConfigurationItem` table stores individual configuration entries with their values. The `ConfigurationVersion` table is useful for tracking changes in configuration values over time and managing configuration versioning.

You can extend this design based on your specific requirements, such as adding more tables or columns to store additional configuration details, or including constraints and indexes for better data integrity and performance.
