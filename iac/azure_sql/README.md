In this example, we're creating an Azure SQL Server and an Azure SQL Database with the following configurations:

- `azurerm_sql_server`: This resource creates the Azure SQL Server.
- `azurerm_sql_database`: This resource creates the Azure SQL Database within the created SQL Server.
- `identity`: This block adds a managed identity to the Azure SQL Server, which can be used to authenticate to other Azure services securely.
- `azurerm_sql_server_firewall_rule`: This resource creates a firewall rule to allow Azure services to access the SQL Server. You can customize the `start_ip_address` and `end_ip_address` to limit the IP addresses allowed to access the server.
- `azurerm_sql_server_auditing`: This resource enables auditing on the SQL Server. The audit logs will be stored in an Azure Storage Account. You'll need to provide the storage account access key and storage endpoint as variables.

Please make sure to add the new variables `storage_account_access_key`, `storage_endpoint`, and `retention_days` to your variables.tf file. The next step would be to review the code and let me know by saying "next" when you're ready for the IaC for Azure Data Factory.
