In this example, we're creating an Azure Databricks workspace with the following configurations:

- `azurerm_databricks_workspace`: This resource creates the Databricks workspace.
- `custom_parameters`: This block configures custom parameters for the workspace. In this case, we're disabling public IP addresses for the workspace with `no_public_ip`.
