In this example, we're creating an Azure Data Factory and an Azure Data Factory Integration Runtime with the following configurations:

- `azurerm_data_factory`: This resource creates the Azure Data Factory.
- `identity`: This block adds a managed identity to the Azure Data Factory, which can be used to authenticate to other Azure services securely.
- `azurerm_data_factory_integration_runtime_azure`: This resource creates the Azure Data Factory Integration Runtime, which is used to execute Data Factory activities.
